        <center><h1>MUSTANG</h1></center>
        <p> &nbsp;The Ford Mustang is a series of American automobiles manufactured by Ford. In continuous production since 1964, the Mustang is currently the longest-produced Ford car nameplate. Currently in its sixth generation, it is the fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate. The namesake of the "pony car" automobile segment, the Mustang was developed as a highly styled line of sporty coupes and convertibles derived from existing model lines, initially distinguished by "long hood, short deck" proportions.

        <center><h1>GTR</h1></center>
        <P> &nbsp; &nbsp;  The Nissan GT-R is a high-performance sports car and grand tourer produced by Nissan that was unveiled in 2007.[2][3][4] It is the successor to the Skyline GT-R, a high performance variant of the Nissan Skyline. Although the car is the sixth-generation model to bear the GT-R name, the model is no longer part of the Nissan Skyline model lineup since that name is now reserved for Nissan's luxury-sport vehicles. The GT-R shares the Nissan FM platform with the now separate Nissan Skyline luxury car and the Nissan Z-car sports car.
